                A Wheatfield with Cypresses is any of three similar 1889 oil paintings 
                by Vincent van Gogh, as part of his wheat field series. All were exhibited 
                at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole mental asylum at Saint-Rémy near Arles, France, 
                where Van Gogh was voluntarily a patient from May 1889 to May 1890. The works 
                were inspired by the view from the window at the asylum towards the Alpilles mountains.

                The painting depicts golden fields of ripe wheat, a dark fastigiate Provençal cypress 
                towering like a green obelisk to the right and lighter green olive trees in the middle distance, 
                with hills and mountains visible behind, and white clouds swirling in an azure sky above. 
                The first version (F717) was painted in late June or early July 1889, during a period of 
                frantic painting and shortly after Van Gogh completed The Starry Night, at a time when he was 
                fascinated by the cypress. It is likely to have been painted "en plein air", near the subject, 
                when Van Gogh was able to leave the precincts of the asylum. Van Gogh regarded this work as one 
                of his best summer paintings.

                Van Gogh had to take time off painting in order to deal with some severe problems 
                due to mental illness in late July and early August, but was able to resume painting 
                in late August and early September 1889. After making a reed-pen drawing of the work, 
                now held by the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, he copied the composition twice in 
                oils in his studio, one approximately the same size (F615) and a smaller version (F743). 
                The larger studio version was probably painted in a single sitting, with a few minor 
                later adjustments adding touches of yellow and brown.
