            <p>
                The curving, swirling lines of hills, mountains, and sky, 
                the brilliantly contrasting blues and yellows, the large, 
                flame-like cypress trees, and the thickly layered brushstrokes 
                of Vincent van Gogh’s The Starry Night are ingrained in the minds 
                of many as an expression of the artist’s turbulent state-of-mind. 
                Van Gogh’s canvas is indeed an exceptional work of art, not only 
                in terms of its quality but also within the artist’s oeuvre, since 
                in comparison to favored subjects like irises, sunflowers, or 
                wheat fields, night landscapes are rare. Nevertheless, it is surprising 
                that The Starry Night has become so well known. Van Gogh mentioned it 
                briefly in his letters as a simple “study of night” or ”night effect.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Van Gogh had had the subject of a blue night sky dotted with yellow stars 
                in mind for many months before he painted The Starry Night in late June 
                or early July of 1889. It presented a few technical challenges he wished 
                to confront—namely the use of contrasting color and the complications of 
                painting en plein air (outdoors) at night—and he referenced it repeatedly 
                in letters to family and friends as a promising if problematic theme. 
                “A starry sky, for example, well – it’s a thing that I’d like to try to do,” 
                Van Gogh confessed to the painter Emile Bernard in the spring of 1888, 
                “but how to arrive at that unless I decide to work at home and from the 
                imagination?” (596, 12 April 1888).
            </p>
            <p>
                As an artist devoted to working whenever possible from prints and illustrations 
                or outside in front of the landscape he was depicting, the idea of painting an 
                invented scene from imagination troubled Van Gogh. When he did paint a first example 
                of the full night sky in Starry Night over the Rhône (1888, oil on canvas, 72.5 x 92 cm, Musée d’Orsay, Paris), 
                an image of the French city of Arles at night, the work was completed outdoors with the help of gas lamplight, 
                but evidence suggests that his second Starry Night was created largely if not exclusively in the studio.
