                Summer's Day (or <i>Jour d'eté</i>) is an oil-on-canvas painting by 
                the French Impressionist painter Berthe Morisot, created in 1879. 
                The painting depicts two women seated in a row boat, and was painted 
                in the Bois de Boulogne. It is held at the National Gallery, in London.

            <p>
                During the winter of 1878–1879, Morisot had her first child, Julie. 
                The following summer, she walked every day with Julie and her nurse 
                in the Bois de Boulogne. After a long period spent indoors, it gave 
                her the wish to start painting outdoors again. However, she did not 
                want to leave her child alone with her nanny for long periods of time. 
                Finally, she found a balance between her maternal duty and her wish to 
                resume her painting, by bringing her models to the park, so she could 
                work there and be with Julie at the same time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Morisot exhibited Summer's Day during the Fifth Great Impressionist Exhibition, 
                in 1880, along with several other works she produced during the summer of 1879. 
                In fact, for the first time, her paintings were received with plenty of enthusiasm 
                and critics particularly praised her subtle use of color.
            </p>
            <p>
                As in almost all her works, Morisot places particular emphasis on the feminine aspect, 
                notably through the choice of motifs and a sensitive representation. The two women occupy 
                the entire foreground, in the boat where they are seated. Visually, Morisot is very close 
                to them and clearly focuses on the psychology of the characters.
