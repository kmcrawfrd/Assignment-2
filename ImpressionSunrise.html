                Claude Monet’s Impression, Sunrise is best known for being the painting 
                that established Impressionism as a new movement in art history, as it shocked 
                critics who first saw it in an 1874 exhibition in Paris.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the surface, the painting appears to capture a quiet morning at Le Havre, 
                but a closer look offers insight into its context. The painting’s material, technique, 
                and subject matter reflects the influence of modernity on artmaking at this time, and also 
                highlights trade networks between France and Japan that gained momentum in the 
                1860s and 1870s. Monet’s Impression, Sunrise is not only an engaging study of the effects
                of light and color, but it also reveals a changing world of industry and global exchange 
                in 19th-century France.
            </p>
            <p>
                The expressive movement of Monet’s brush is evident in the streaks of orange, red, pink,
                gray, blue, and white pigment that blend together to form the misty sky over Le Havre. 
                These painterly brushstrokes reflect a new technique called en plein air (“in open air”), 
                which gained popularity in the 1860s. Artists that worked in this style left their studios
                to paint outdoors, using rapid brushstrokes to quickly capture the effect of light and 
                color on the atmosphere.
            </p>

                Although Impression, Sunrise was painted in a room overlooking the port, Monet had started
                experimenting with the plein air technique by 1872, and an 1885 painting by John Singer Sargent 
                shows him painting in this style.
