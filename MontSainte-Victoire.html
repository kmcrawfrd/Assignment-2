                In this work, Cézanne divides his composition into three roughly equal 
                orizontal sections, which extend across the three-foot wide canvas. 
                Our viewpoint is elevated. Closest to us lies a band of foliage and houses; 
                next, rough patches of yellow ochre, emerald, and viridian green suggest 
                the patchwork of an expansive plain and extend the foreground’s color scheme 
                into the middleground; and above, in contrasting blues, violets and greys, 
                we see the “craggy mountain” surrounded by sky. The blues seen in this section 
                also accent the rest of the work while, conversely, touches of green enliven 
                the sky and mountain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cézanne evokes a deep, panoramic scene and the atmosphere that fills and unifies 
                this space. But it is absolutely characteristic of his art that we also remain acutely 
                aware of the painting as a fairly rough, if deftly, worked surface. Flatness coexists 
                with depth and we find ourselves caught between these two poles—now more aware of one, 
                now the other. The mountainous landscape is both within our reach, yet far away.

                Cézanne had presumably stood on this summit, or these summits, several times. 
                He had thoroughly explored the countryside around Aix, first during youthful rambles 
                with his friends and later as a plein-air artist in search of motifs. And we know 
                for certain that he had climbed to the top of the mountain as recently as 1895. 
                Armed with these experiences, he could have estimated the distance from Les Lauves 
                to the top of Mont Sainte-Victoire with some accuracy—it’s about ten miles (16 kilometers) 
                as the crow flies.
